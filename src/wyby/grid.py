"""Grid and cell types for the virtual frame buffer.

This module provides :class:`Cell` and :class:`CellBuffer` — the data
types that sit between game logic and the renderer.  Game code writes
characters and styles into a :class:`CellBuffer`; the renderer reads the
buffer and converts it to Rich renderables for terminal output.

The buffer is implemented as a **list of lists** (rows × columns) of
:class:`Cell` objects.  This layout was chosen for compositing:

- Straightforward row-major iteration for conversion to Rich ``Table``.
- Multiple sources (background tiles, entities, UI overlays) write into
  the same buffer in z-order, with later writes overwriting earlier ones.
- The buffer is a plain Python data structure with **no Rich dependency**,
  so it can be tested and inspected without a terminal.

Caveats
-------
- **No double-buffering.**  There is a single buffer; the renderer reads
  whatever state it finds when ``present()`` is called.  If the game
  loop mutates the buffer while the renderer is converting it to Rich
  output, torn frames are possible.  In practice the single-threaded
  game loop prevents this, but be aware of it if concurrency is added.
- **Full-buffer clear every frame.**  ``clear()`` rewrites every cell.
  For large buffers (e.g. 200×60 = 12 000 cells) this is measurable but
  still fast enough for 30 FPS on modern hardware.  A dirty-region
  system could be added later as an optimisation.
- **Terminal cells are not square.**  A typical terminal character cell
  is roughly twice as tall as it is wide (~1:2 aspect ratio).  Nothing
  in this module corrects for that — callers must account for it when
  designing visuals.
- **Unicode width is not handled here.**  CJK characters occupy 2 cells,
  and emoji width varies by terminal.  ``put_text`` and ``draw_text``
  place one ``Cell`` per Python character; correct multi-cell handling
  is deferred to a future ``wcwidth`` integration.
- **No bounds errors.**  ``put()`` and ``put_text()`` silently clip
  writes that fall outside the buffer.  ``get()`` returns ``None`` for
  out-of-bounds coordinates.  This keeps rendering code simple (no need
  to pre-clip) but means typos in coordinates fail silently.

        Caveats:
            - ``Style`` attributes that are ``None`` (meaning "not set"
              / "inherit") map to the Cell default: ``None`` for colours,
              ``False`` for bold/dim.  There is no style inheritance in
              CellBuffer.
            - ``Style.color`` and ``Style.bgcolor`` are converted to
              strings via ``str()``.  This produces Rich-compatible
              colour names (``"red"``, ``"#ff0000"``, etc.) but the
              CellBuffer does not validate colour values — invalid
              strings pass through and may cause errors at render time.
            - Only ``bold`` and ``dim`` are mapped.  ``italic``,
              ``underline``, ``blink``, ``reverse``, and ``strike``
              are part of Rich's ``Style`` but are not representable
              in :class:`Cell`.  If you need those, render directly
              with Rich rather than through CellBuffer.
            - Same clipping behaviour as :meth:`put_text`: characters
              outside the buffer bounds are silently ignored.
            - Same Unicode caveat as :meth:`put_text`: each Python
              character is treated as one cell wide.  CJK and emoji
              that occupy two terminal columns are not handled correctly.
